# LED-Matrix
These python files using circuitpython are how I communicate with my LED Matrix by Adafruit. The bitcoin configuration can be found online [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/bitcoin-value-rgb-matrix-display/overview). I wanted something to pull real-time data from the stock market so I utilized finnhub's API to do exactly this. The GME python file will display the GME background associated with it, as well as pulling data from finnhub to display GameStop's current stock value. 

This was a fun project to work on as it also involved some physical setup. Seeing the lights on the board light up for the first time definitely got me excited to see what I could make this thing do eventually.
